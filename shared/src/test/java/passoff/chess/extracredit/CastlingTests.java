/**
 * Tests if the ChessGame implementation can handle Castling moves
 * Castling is a situational move the king can make as it's first move. If one of the rooks has not yet moved
 * and there are no pieces between the rook and the king, and the path is "safe", the king can castle. Castling is
 * performed by moving the king 2 spaces towards the qualifying rook, and the rook "jumping" the king to sit next
 * to the king on the opposite side it was previously. A path is considered "safe" if 1: the king is not in check
 * and 2: neither the space the king moves past nor the space the king ends up at can be reached by an opponents piece.
